    "text": "As a die-hard Brisbane Lions supporter and an extreme data enthusiast, I understand that ingrained bias can distort perspectives, but data often provides comfort and clarity.\nHowever, anyone who watched the Brisbane Lions’ 2024 matches could not ignore that the team’s performance would have been far worse without the heroics of key defender and co-captain Harris Andrews.\nTherefore, it was shocking when the AFL left him out of the All-Australian team announced on August 29. Many considered him an absolute lock for the team.\nInstead, the key defensive positions went to Jeremy McGovern from the West Coast Eagles, Jacob Weitering from the Carlton Blues, and Luke Ryan from the Fremantle Dockers.\nAll great players, no doubt, but were they better than Harris Andrews this year?\nDriven by frustration, I turned to uncovering the cold, hard facts, determined to prove that the selectors made a huge mistake by excluding the Lions’ defensive talisman from the team for the second consecutive year.\nI sought to understand whether Harris Andrews was truly robbed of an All-Australian jersey, as many, especially Lions fans, claimed. After analysing the key statistical categories for a key defender, I am confident that Harris was indeed unfairly overlooked.\nBut let’s see how Andrews’ season compares to his defensive peers by the numbers."

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nTo understand, I went straight to the 2024 season data and pulled key metrics that underpin the role of a key defender in Australian Rules Football.\nThese metrics include:\n\nIntercepts\nContested Marks\nSpoils\nRebound 50s\nOne percenters\n\nThese data were pulled via the fitzRoy API, which taps into a wide range of AFL data sources including Footywire.\nBut why these categories?\nPrimarily because many sites that track player characteristics (for example, Stats Insiders) use similar categories to define a key defender. There might be some debate about whether these are the right ones, but I’ve settled on these for the time being.\nSince many AFL players occasionally take on defensive roles (e.g., Nick Daicos playing off half-back early in 2024), I filtered the data to include only those who played defensive positions for at least 80% of the season.\nIn most cases, I highlighted the main players in this analysis: Andrews, McGovern, Weitering, and Ryan."

Andrews follows closely, averaging just over 7.5 per game and ranking 8th. Neither Weitering nor Ryan made the top ten, with Ryan ranking 27th with 5.83 intercepts per game. For reference, Sam Collins holds the top spot, averaging 8 intercepts per game."

Both McGovern and Weitering also performed well, ranking 4th and 5th, respectively. However, Ryan lagged behind, averaging only 0.4 contested marks per game, ranking 36th."

Weitering also made the top 10 with 6.71 per game. McGovern and Ryan were more middle of the pack, ranking 20th and 31st, respectively."

    "text": "Overall Rank\nBy now, you probably see where this analysis is heading.\nBut for clarity’s sake, here’s a highlight table showing the rank positions of our chosen key defenders in the metrics that really matter for their role.\n\n\n\nOverall Rankings | Credit: TheDatavist\n\n\nAs you can see, Jeremy McGovern and Harris Andrews average out at 2nd and 3rd, respectively. Interestingly, McGovern’s teammate Tom Barrass takes the top spot! Barrass fans might argue he’s been hard done by as well (congrats to the Hawks on what looks like a stellar signing on paper).\nThere’s probably a whole other blog needed to explain why two Eagles players rank 1st and 2nd in key defender stats despite their team’s overall defensive struggles—but we’ll save that for another day.\nAnyway, while the evidence shows that Weitering probably earned his blazer, ranking 5th overall in these metrics, the data suggests that Luke Ryan is statistically a much weaker player in the key defender role. He might count himself incredibly lucky to have snagged that All-Australian spot, especially with Andrews outperforming him in most key metrics.\nSorry, Freo fans—nothing personal against Luke Ryan, but the stats (mostly) don’t lie.\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading. You’re welcome to send me your thoughts if you wish (hopefully not abuse!).\nAnd if you have any angles you’d think worthwhile exploring on this data, suggest it, and I’ll see if I can dig into it, if time permits."
