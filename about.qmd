Why, hello there!

The Datavist is a collection of ideas, thoughts and shared learnings about the data profession and related miscellanry written by Darragh Murray, a data analytics and insights professional based in Brisbane, Australia.

I've been working in the data or data-adjacent field for over twenty years now, and I'd like to think I have some idea of what's what, even if I consider myself a bit of a jack of all trades in the data profession.

I also occsaionally publish data-driven analysis in areas where I'm particularly passionate - such as the study of history, international relations and AFL!
